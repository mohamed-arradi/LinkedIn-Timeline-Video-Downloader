LinkedinVideoDownloader allow you to download videos from your LinkedIn timeline. 

In the past LinkedIn allowed user to download embedded video from posts and timeline, but now it is not possible unless you deep dive in the source code which is quite annoying.

With this add-on you can download the embedded link with one 1 click. 

**Beware** it works only with **embedded** videos. (not external player such as Youtube, Vimeo, dailymotion, etc).
